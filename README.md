# k-mobx-react

ðŸš§ this is a work in progress ðŸš§

Connect MobX (and mobx-state-tree) to React with plain old JS props!
> This is a better isolation of concerns

## Purpose
This library offer the same `inject` API that the standard [mobx-react](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react) library.
What differs is about the types of props that are injected in the wrapped ReactJS component.

 - With the standard `mobx-react` the props injected can be observable.
 - With `k-mobx-react` the props injected **are** plain old JS objects.

## Why
We feel that observable object in ReactJS component enforce bad pattern of developments:
 - It pushed the use of nested props into a ReactJS component
    * We think that flat props are best because it is easier to optimise this kind of components
 - You have to use customs `PropTypes`
 - You can't bind a common React Component with this kind of objects
    * We have some problems our existing React components that did not always worked as expected

## Installation
 - `npm install --save k-mobx-react`
 - `yarn add k-mobx-react`

## API
 - You can just change you `mobx-react` import with the new one: `k-mobx-react`
 - If you use nested props, you should changes them to use flat props

## Examples
